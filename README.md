# COMP9032---Microprocessors

The final project for UNSW's Microprocessor course was a helicopter simulator. Please note that in order to run
the source code you will need:
- A microprocessor board supplied by UNSW
- AVR Studio - Used to compile the source code and upload it to the board.

Documents included in this project include:
* The source code - This is the code that runs the simulator.
* Design Manual - Descibes the data structures and algorithms used in making the simulator
                  and explains the reasons for their implementation.
* System Control Flow - Shows how the various functions in the source code interact with each other.
* User Manual - Explains how to use the simulator.

I was rather proud of this code as it resulted in an simulator that was super responsive and 
changed directions or speed as soon as the user touched the relevant button.
